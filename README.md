# Bamazon-MySQL

### Overview
In this assignment, I created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL database. The application works by taking in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The application should prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.



### Customer View

The products should have each of the following columns:

   * item_id (unique id for each product)

   * product_name (Name of product)

   * department_name

   * price (cost to customer)

   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
